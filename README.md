# Python Sphinx POC

## Introduction

The goal of this repository is to test out how sphinx documentation is displayed
for various fields.

The tests of this repository are made so that:
[Human Readable OpenAPI Client Generator](https://github.com/Clarensia/Human-Readable-OpenAPI-Client-Generator)
can write Python code that is automatically documented.
